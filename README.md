# android-diceout
This repository contains an app which will simulate rolling three dice and scoring a certain number of points for different combinations. 

When the app is launched you'll see this layout, the app will show a green background, and some text at the top and the bottom. There are three dice that appear in the middle and there is a Roll button that is customized with an image in the lower right corner. When you click the button or tap it if you have a touchscreen, the dice will change. If you get a matching pair you score 50 points. If you get three of a kind, you'll score based on the combination, 100 for three ones, 200 for three twos, 300 for three threes, et cetera.
